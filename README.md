# Introduction 

This demo is a basic extension of an existing Azure IoT tutorial to demonstrate SAP connectivity leveraging a public SAP Gateway demo system. 

The intention is to have a repeatable and public SAP and Azure IoT demo based on:

* Azure Raspberry emulator

* Azure IoT Hub and Logic App

* Public SAP demo system 

![Demo high level overview](https://github.com/ROBROICH/REPO1/blob/master/images/DEMO_ARCHITECTURE.jpg)

# Demo scenario and basic story line 

* Imagine the Raspberry Emulator as IoT device used in shipping of heat-sensitive vaccines

* If the temperature is measured above 30°, the vaccine is damaged and must be replaced  

* To replace the vaccine, a sales order is automatically created in SAP ECC in case the measured temperature is above 30° 

* For excel users the current sales order SAP ECC will be displayed in Excel 

# Demo implementation

The following steps are required to implement the demo:

* Raspberry PI emulator
* Notifications with Azure Logic Apps
* Get access to public SAP system
* Adjust Logic-App
* Show sales order in Excel or Power BI

## Raspberry PI emulator & Notifications with Azure Logic Apps

* Implement Raspberry PI emulator tutorial ([Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-web-simulator-get-started))

* Implement IoT remote monitoring and notifications with Azure Logic Apps connecting your IoT hub and mailbox tutorial ([Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-monitoring-notifications-with-azure-logic-apps))  Stop at the paragraph “Configure the logic app trigger”

## Access to public SAP demo system

* Prerequisite: S-User or user for ([SAP Community](https://community.sap.com/)). In case required sign-up for a user. 
 
* Get access to SAP Gateway demo system([Link](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/12/05/new-sap-gateway-demo-system-available/comment-page-1/))

* Get familiar with [GWSampleBasic](https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/SalesOrderSet?(%270500000001%27)/ToLineItems) Odata Service ([Visual-Code REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient))

## Logic App implementation 
Remark: Without the support of Bartosz Jarkowski the demo would end here. Further details [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/05/28/your-sap-on-azure-part-18-the-story-of-a-missing-csrf-token/). 

Finish the [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-monitoring-notifications-with-azure-logic-apps) until : Configure the logic app trigger / 5. Create a service bus connection.
Instead of creating an STMP connection, create a HTTP GET Action

### GET Request 

```
URI: https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/SalesOrderSet/
Header parameter:
Connection: keep-alive
X-CSRF-Token: fetch
Authentication: Basic
User/Pwd: Credentials for SAP demo system
```

![GET Request](https://github.com/ROBROICH/REPO1/blob/master/images/Get1.jpg)

### POST Request 

* Append a HTTP POST Action to the GET-request 
* The logic app creates an SAP sales order via the Odata Gateway

```
Headers: 
"Connection": "keep-alive",
"X-Requested-With": "XMLHttpRequest",
"x-csrf-token": "@outputs('GET')['headers']['x-csrf-token']"

## Run the demo 
* Run the logic app
* Run the Raspberry emulator. Wait until the emulator sends an alert, when temperature is >30°
* The logic app gets executed 

![Logic App](https://github.com/ROBROICH/REPO1/blob/master/images/post_finished.png)

## Check data in excel 
After the logic app got executed, the data is stored in SAP and available for consumption by business users. 

![Run the demo](https://github.com/ROBROICH/REPO1/blob/master/images/run%20the%20demo.png)

Connect to Odata datasource
